## Problem Statement

In many industrial and manufacturing environments, workers and managers face extensive documentation requirements, including maintenance logs, safety checks, task updates, and other procedural notes. This manual logging is time-consuming, susceptible to errors, and often lacks the structure needed to drive insights or facilitate decision-making. Consequently, the absence of a centralized, structured log system leads to missed opportunities for identifying bottlenecks, recurring issues, and improvement areas. Existing solutions often offer basic digital logs without leveraging the historical data for proactive decision-making.

## Proposed Solution

### Automated, Contextualized Logging System with Decision Recommendations

- **Automated Logging**: Employees will verbally or textually log tasks and observations into the system. AI will convert these logs into structured, tagged data points.
- **Pattern Recognition**: The system uses historical logs to recognize patterns in inefficiencies or task delays, suggesting improvements in real time.
- **Decision Recommendation Engine**: Based on previous logs, the AI suggests best practices or solutions to workers facing similar situations, improving problem resolution and operational efficiency.

### Differentiator

Unlike typical logging tools, this system not only automates the documentation process but actively uses historical data to drive decisions and recommend improvements. By automating log creation and turning it into a knowledge base, it becomes a dynamic resource that grows over time, eliminating passive record-keeping.

### How To Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages by running `npm i` in both backend and frontend directories.
3. Start the backend server by going to backend directory
   `cd ./backend`
   run server using command `node server.js` in the backend directory.
4. Start the frontend server by going to frontend directory
   `cd ./frontend`
   run server using command `npm run dev` in the frontend directory.
